# General description

This repository includes code to define grammars of Samoan stress over
monomorphs in xfst, and to compare their output with the correct "gold
standard" output.

**To run this code you need to install `xfst`, which is available [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~laurik/.book2software/):**

The repository contains two sub-directories:

1. `xfst-code`: this contains shell scripts and xfst code to define
   the grammars and compare them to the gold standard. More details
   are in the section [xfst code](#xfst-code).
2. `otsoft-files`: this contains files from runs with [OTSoft](http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/otsoft/) that show
   how partial rankings were computed. More details are in the section
   [OTSoft files](#otsoft-files).

# xfst code 

The `xfst-code` directory contains a `Makefile` and five
sub-directories:

1. `auxiliary`: this contains auxiliary files that are called by
   `xfst` in the definition of the grammars, an input file to test
   grammars for overgeneration, and "gold standard" output files that
   contain the correct set of outputs that should be generated by the grammars. 
2. `dir-ft`: this contains `xfst` code to define the direct-foot
   grammar, two text files `chk-overgen.txt` and `chk-undergen.txt`
   generated by the `xfst` code to check for over- and
   under-generation, and a `Makefile` that is called by the `Makefile`
   in the top-level directory (`xfst-code/`)
3. `dir-syll`: like `dir-ft`, but `xfst` code defines direct-syllable grammar.
4. `ot-ft`: like `dir-ft`, but `xfst` code defines OT-foot grammar.
5. `ot-syll`: like `dir-ft`, but `xfst` code defines OT-syllable grammar.

In the `xfst-code` directory, to run the direct foot code, type:

```bash
make dir-ft
```

To run the direct syllable code, type:

```bash
make dir-syll
```

To run the OT foot code, type:

```bash
make ot-ft
```

To run the OT syllable code, type:

```bash
make ot-syll
```


# OTSoft files

The `otsoft-files` directory contains two sub-directories:

1. `ft`: this contains files computing the partial ranking of the
   OT constraint set referring to feet given in the paper
2. `syll`: this contains files computing the partial ranking of OT
   constraint sets referring only to syllables
   - `actual`: contains files from the OT constraint set given in the
     paper
   - `test-with-rlt`: contains files from a larger OT constraint set
     including constraints in Kager (2001) and (2005) rhythmic
     licensing theory, to show that even with all those constraints in
     the constraint set, the gradient Align constraints are still necessary.
